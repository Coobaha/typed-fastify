# Overview

Sound Types
:
Enhance TypeScript support for Fastify request handlers
and generate runtime validation for requests and responses with `%pkg%`

OpenAPI Schema
: Design your service using the OpenAPI schema in TypeScript and utilize the types you already use directly in the API
contract.

Type safety end-to-end
: Package generates runtime validations based on your schema and enforces returning correct data at the type
level.


## What are the benefits?

- `%pkg%` adds strong TypeScript support to Fastify request handlers
- Fastify validates Requests and Responses in runtime based on the JSON Schema
- Type safety end-to-end, you avoid common mistakes when writing request handlers.
- Fast feedback loop, you get errors in your IDE based on types and in runtime.
- You can use the same types in your API contract and in your code.
